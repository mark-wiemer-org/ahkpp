-   Start and stop scripts via VS Code keybindings

More changes are listed below the breaking changes...

### ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Breaking changes

Settings are now organized into flat objects for a better user experience. Unfortunately, this means settings will have to be replaced when upgrading to AHK++ 6. This is a one-time fixup. Below are sample settings matching the new schema and default values of AHK++. You can learn more about the settings via VS Code's settings UI (`Ctrl + ,`)

### ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Breaking changes

For [technical reasons](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions), this is tagged with `5.1.0`, but it may be a breaking release and the full release will be tagged `6.0.0`

</details>

-   Fix readme: v2 debugger works via commands, just not via "run and debug" viewlet

## 5.0.6 - 2024-08-17 üìù

Changes to the marketplace page require a new version. This version has no user-facing changes, just documentation updates:

-   Update package description to clarify v2 support is in preview
-   Update readme to clarify v2 support is in preview

Full v2 support (IntelliSense, debugging, formatting) is coming later this month! ([Issue #453](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/453))

-   Update internal dependencies for security ([PR #435](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/pull/435))

## 5.0.3 - 2023-08-21 üèÑ

-   Fix extension crash when switching to a nullish editor ([Issue #398](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/398))

## 5.0.2 - 2023-08-10 üêà

-   Fix language mode resetting when VS Code restarts ([Issue #392](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/392))

## 5.0.1 - 2023-08-08 üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

-   `ahk++.file.interpreterPathV2` now defaults to `C:/Program Files/AutoHotkey/v2/AutoHotkey64.exe` ([Issue #387](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/387))

AutoHotkey v2 support now in preview! Please test it out and [report any issues](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/new?assignees=mark-wiemer&labels=AHK+v2&projects=&template=v2.md&title=%5Bv2%5D+), you'll help the community of 120,000+ users of this extension!

Be sure to go to the settings and update the new `V2` settings in case the defaults aren't correct üòä

### ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Breaking changes

-   Rename some settings. Users will have to manually adjust these new settings from the defaults to match their old settings:
    -   `ahk++.compiler.compileBaseFile` is now `ahk++.compiler.compileBaseFileV1`
    -   `ahk++.file.compilePath` is now `ahk++.file.compilerPath`
    -   `ahk++.file.executePath` is now `ahk++.file.interpreterPathV1`
    -   `ahk++.file.helpPath` is now `ahk++.file.helpPathV1`
    -   `ahk++.file.templateSnippetName` is now `ahk++.file.templateSnippetNameV1` with default value `AhkTemplateV1`

### Other changes

-   Allow `.ahk1` and `.ah1` extensions for v1 scripts, `.ahk2` and `.ah2` for v2 scripts. `.ahk` and `.ext` can be used for either version, but default to AHK v2 ([Issue #396](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/396))
    -   The original changelog entry mentioned that the shared file extensions defaulted to AHK v1--this was incorrect
    -   You can add a `#Requires AutoHotkey v1` directive to the top of an of `.ahk` file to have it automatically load in AHK v1 independent of VS Code settings ([Issue #392](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/392))
    -   The same can be done with `#Requires AutoHotkey v2`
    -   Alternatively, you can follow the below steps to associate all `.ahk` files with AHK v1:
        1. Open a `.ahk` file
        1. `F1` -> "Change language mode"
        1. "Configure file association for `.ahk` files"
        1. "AutoHotkey v1"
-   Automatically change AHK version to match the `#Requires` directive near the top of any script the first time that script is opened
-   Allow running and debugging v1 or v2 scripts without changing settings
-   "Open help" (Ctrl + F1) now opens version-specific help
-   Add full syntax highlighting for v2 scripts thanks to [AutoHotkey v2 Language Support by thqby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp)
-   Update icons (found next to a script's name in the explorer)
    -   v2 scripts will have official green icons, while v1 scripts now have modified blue icons
    -   Icons are a bit smaller to align with existing VS Code icons

### Known issues

Some features are not added to this initial preview release, but will be coming soon!

-   Missing features for AHK v2:
    -   Formatting ([Issue #381](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/381))
    -   Snippets ([Issue #382](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/382))

### Thank you!

This update relies heavily on open-source code from [thqby](https://github.com/thqby) and [Steve Gray (Lexikos)](https://github.com/Lexikos). Thank you for your awesome work!

## 4.1.0 - 2023-08-03 üôã

-   Add quick help, adapted from thqby's AutoHotkey v2 Language Support
    -   Selected text (or word at cursor) is now searched within the help documentation
    -   Known limitation: if selected text would cause a syntax error when injected into a script, help is activated but no search is made. [Issue #376](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/376)
-   Update file icon to match [official AHK repository](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/blob/446829bc730aa002635d3d36bfd17e892b6981c0/source/resources/icons.svg)

## 4.0.0 - 2023-07-29 üçÄ

### ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Breaking changes

-   Rename some settings. Users will have to manually adjust these new settings from the defaults to match their old settings:

    -   `ahk++.language.enableIntellisense` is now `ahk++.intellisense.enableIntellisense`
    -   `ahk++.file.maximumParseLength` is now `ahk++.intellisense.maximumParseLength`

### Other changes

-   IntelliSense no longer suggests words when a user presses space ([Issue #110](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/110))
-   IntelliSense now suggests `foo(p1, p2)` instead of `foo (p1,p2)`
-   Improved descriptions of settings
