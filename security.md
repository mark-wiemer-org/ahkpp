# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All non-[yanked](./Changelog.md#283-yanked---2022-07-04-🦅) versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please don't report security issues or suspected security issues via GitHub. Instead, you can probably guess my email, or talk to literally anyone else. I'm not a security expert. This is a VS Code extension. I don't expect any security issues.
