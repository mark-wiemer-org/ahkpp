# Features

Most features are documented through the tests. Engineering hygiene is maintained through the `npm run validate` step.

Some features need to be manually validated when they're modified. The rest of this document covers these features. **This document is not complete.**

## Developers

-   Run all unit tests through VS Code GUI (Run and Debug launch configuration "Test Extension"). This should clean, re-compile, and run all tests. Output appears in the debug console. All tests should pass, of course.
