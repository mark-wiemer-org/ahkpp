## package.json contributions

### New commands

-   Debug AHK and Attach (`ahk++.debugAttach`): Debug and attach to the debug session for advanced use-cases. Requires zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug.
-   Debug AHK with Params (`ahk++.debugParams`): Debug and add user-provided command-line arguments to the debugger for advanced use-cases. Requires zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug.
-   Run AHK++ Diagnostic (`ahk++.diagnostic.full`): Effectively restart the AHK v2 features of the app.
-   Export AHK Symbols (`ahk++.exportSymbols`): Export application functions and classes to a new file. Only for AHK v2.
-   Stop AHK Script (`ahk++.stop`): Stop an AHK script of user choice ran via `Run AHK Script` or any of the `Debug AHK ...` commands. If only one script is running, stop that without asking for confirmation.
-   Add Doc Comment (`ahk++.addDocComment`): Add a function header comment for the current function
-   Update File Version Info (`ahk++.updateVersionInfo`): Add or update a file header comment
-   Switch AHK Version (`ahk++.switchAhkVersion`): Change between v1 and v2 for the current file
-   Select AHK Syntaxes (`ahk++.selectSyntaxes`): Select custom syntax files for advanced use-cases. Only for AHK v2. PRs are welcomed if the default syntaxes aren't sufficient!

### New settings

All new settings are in the `V2` settings category

-   Library Suggestions: Whether to suggest functions included in library files
-   Comment Tag Regex: The regular expression for custom symbols to appear in the breadcrumb and elsewhere. Default matches any line that starts with `;;`
-   Complete Function Calls: Whether to automatically add parenetheses when calling a function
-   Debug Configuration: The [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) to use when debugging
-   Diagnostics
    -   Class Non Dynamic Member Check: Check whether non-dynamic members of a class exist when lexing
    -   Params Check: Check that the function call has the correct number of arguments
-   Formatter: Options for how to format a file. v1 and v2 formatters have their own settings.
-   Warn
    -   Var Unset: Display a warning when referencing an unassigned variable. Changes take effect after restart.
    -   Local Same As Global: Display warnings for each undeclared local variable that has the same name as a global variable. Changes take effect after restart.
    -   Call Without Parentheses: Display warnings for each function or method call without parentheses. Changes take effect after restart.

## Known issues

### Blocking

These issues will be resolved before a full release

-   [#486](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/486)
-   Ensure commands work with both v1 and v2 as intended
-   Cleanup and organize settings names and IDs
-   Dedupe configuration values
-   [Release pipeline](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) has been changed to push pre-releases. Definitely fix this for the final release ðŸ˜‰

### Low priority

These issues will be backlogged and resolved after a full release

-   No newline at end of file when formatting (inconsistent with v1 and industry standards)
-   No browser support (AHK++ did not have this before, we can add it later if users want it)
-   Hardlink config files shared between ahk2 submodule and global package (e.g. `*.nls*.json`)
-   Explain formatter options
