# Full v2 integration

This doc covers all the new features as a result of integrating with thqby's AHK v2 Language Support extension. See [known issues](#known-issues) at the bottom of this file

## The big changes

-   Formatting support
-   Snippets support
-   Better v2 IntelliSense support: rename, better hovers, and more

## package.json contributions

### New commands

-   Debug AHK and Attach (`ahk++.debugAttach`): Like Debug AHK Script, except attach to the debug session for advanced use-cases. Requires zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug.
-   Debug AHK with Params (`ahk++.debugParams`): Like Debug AHK Script, except add user-provided command-line arguments to the debugger for advanced use-cases. Requires zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug.
-   Run AHK++ Diagnostic (`ahk++.diagnostic.full`): Effectively restart the AHK v2 features of the app. Future work may do a full reset of the entire AHK++ extension.
-   Export AHK Symbols (`ahk++.exportSymbols`): Exports application functions and classes to a new file.
-   Stop AHK Script (`ahk++.stop`): Stop an AHK script of user choice ran via `Run AHK Script` or any of the `Debug AHK ...` commands. If only one script is running, stop that without asking for confirmation.

## Known issues

### Blocking

These issues will be resolved before a full release

-   Needs more tests!! Many features have not been tested at all, hence the pre-release!
-   [Release pipeline](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) has been changed to push pre-releases. Definitely fix this for the final release ðŸ˜‰

### Low priority

These issues will be backlogged and resolved after a full release

-   No newline at end of file when formatting (inconsistent with v1 and industry standards)
-   No browser support (AHK++ did not have this before, we can add it later if users want it)
