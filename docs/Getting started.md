  1. VS Code (of course!)
1. Clone the repo
1. Setup the repo
  1. `npm install`

To verify everything is set up correctly, open the "Run and Debug" viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D`) and Start Debugging the "Launch Extension" configuration (`F5`). This should open a new VS Code window that has the extension activated :)
