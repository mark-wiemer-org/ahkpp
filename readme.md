💚 Special thanks to [thqby](https://github.com/thqby), as this would not have been possible without thqby's open-source [AutoHotkey v2 Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp)!

## Why AutoHotkey Plus Plus?

AutoHotkey Plus Plus is one of many extensions that offer VS Code language support. So why should you use this one?

-   **Supports both v1 and v2**: AHK++ supports both AHK v1 and v2, making it the only extension to support both major versions of AutoHotkey!
-   **Actively maintained**: Any issues encountered while using this extension can be reported and fixed. With other extensions, anything that's broken will stay broken forever. You can report any issues with AHK++ (and view all issues) through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus/issues).
-   **IntelliSense**: Smart code completion, syntax highlighting, code navigation, and more.
-   **Debug support**: Run and debug AHK scripts from VS Code.
-   **New features**: Another benefit to active maintenance is that AHK++ can add new features as users request them. For example, quick help, formatter directives, and custom new file templates were all added based on user feedback!

## Commands

With AHK++, you can compile, debug, and run your scripts with keyboard shortcuts. You can also run a selection as a standalone script.

-   Compile: `Ctrl + Shift + F9`
-   Debug: `Ctrl + Alt + F9`
-   Open help: `Ctrl + F1`
-   Run: `Ctrl + F9`
-   Run selection: `Ctrl + F8`

## Debug

> There are some [known issues with the debugger](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adebugger). If you need an advanced setup, we recommend [zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug).

1. Click the debug button in the editor title menu (at the top right of the editor) or press `Ctrl + Alt + F9`.
2. The debugger supports breakpoints, stack tracing, and variable watching

#### Formatter Directives

Formatter directives instruct the formatter to behave a certain way on sections of code.

1. `FormatBlockComment`:

    ```autohotkey
    ;@AHK++FormatBlockCommentOn
    /*
    ;All text inside block comment will be formatted like regular code.
    */
    ;@AHK++FormatBlockCommentOff
    ```

2. `AlignAssignment`:

    ```autohotkey
    ;@AHK++AlignAssignmentOn
    a          = 5 ; number five
    str        = legacy text = with equal symbol
    inputFile := "movie.mkv"
    abc       := "abc" ; string
    abc       := a + b
    ;@AHK++AlignAssignmentOff
    ```
