Install from a marketplace: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mark-wiemer.vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus) | [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/mark-wiemer/vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus)

## AHK v2 full support is here! 🥂

AHK++ 6 now incorporates [AutoHotkey v2 Language Support by thqby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp), meaning full AHK v2 support:

-   Running, debugging, and stopping v1 and v2 scripts without changing settings
-   Full syntax highlighting for v2 scripts
-   "Open help" (`Ctrl + F1`) opens language-specific help (and includes your text selection)
-   Unique icons for AHK v1 (blue) and v2 (green)
-   Rich IntelliSense support with snippets, hover text, and suggestions
-   Formatting files with many customized options

For all changes, including breaking changes, see [the changelog](./Changelog.md)

As always, please [🐛 report any issues](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/new/choose)

💚 Special thanks again to [thqby](https://github.com/thqby), as this would not have been possible without thqby's open-source [AutoHotkey v2 Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp)!

### ⛓️‍💥 Breaking changes

When adding all the new settings, VS Code's setting UX became overwhelming. Settings are now organized into flat objects, which should improve UX and reduce the need for breaking changes in the future! See [the changelog](./Changelog.md) for details.

## Commands

With AHK++, you can compile, debug, and run your scripts with keyboard shortcuts. You can also run a selection as a standalone script.

-   Compile: `Ctrl + Shift + F9`
-   Debug: `Ctrl + Alt + F9`
-   Open help: `Ctrl + F1`
-   Run: `Ctrl + F9`
-   Run selection: `Ctrl + F8`
-   Stop: `Ctrl + F6`

## Debug

> There are some [known issues with the debugger](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adebugger). If you need an advanced setup, we recommend [zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug) for now. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/new/choose) if the built-in debugger does not support your needs. As `zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug` is [closed-source](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/vscode-autohotkey-debug/discussions/332), we will be working to introduce advanced debugger features to ensure an open-source, collaborative, complete extension is available to the AHK community 🙂

1. Click the debug button in the editor title menu (at the top right of the editor) or press `Ctrl + Alt + F9`.
2. The debugger supports breakpoints, stack tracing, and variable watching

### Debug features

1. **Output message**: You can use `OutputDebug` command instead of `MsgBox` to log values.

    ![Output](image/output.jpg)

2. **Evaluate**: Set and get variable values through the debug console.

This extension provides basic debugging functions. If you need more debugging functions (such as conditional breakpoints), you can add an additional extension: [Install vscode-autohotkey-debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug).

## Language Features

### IntelliSense

Supports IntelliSense for variables and functions.

### Function symbol

1. You can add a comment to the function using a semicolon on the line above the function declaration

### Go to definition

1. Supports navigation to symbol definition.
2. Usage: Ctrl-click on the symbol to navigate to its definition.

![Goto Definition](image/gotoDefinition.jpg)

### Find symbol references

Select a symbol, then:

-   Right-click and select `Find All References`.
-   Or press `Shift + F12`.

### Hover tip

Usage: Hover over symbol to see IntelliSense documentation.

![Hover](image/hover.png)

### Outline

Assign name to block of code via double semicolon comment `;;Name` and go to it from outline.

![Block Name](image/blockName.png)

### Folding

Custom folding regions:

```autohotkey
;region
MsgBox % "Collapse me!"
;endregion

; Block comments with regions
/* ;region
Collapse me!
*/ ;endregion
```

### Code format

Supports standard VS Code formatting with a few options.

![Code Format](image/codeFormat.jpg)

#### Formatter Directives

Formatter directives instruct the formatter to behave a certain way on sections of code.

1. `FormatBlockComment`:

    ```autohotkey
    ;@AHK++FormatBlockCommentOn
    /*
    ;All text inside block comment will be formatted like regular code.
    */
    ;@AHK++FormatBlockCommentOff
    ```

2. `AlignAssignment`:

    ```autohotkey
    ;@AHK++AlignAssignmentOn
    a          = 5 ; number five
    str        = legacy text = with equal symbol
    inputFile := "movie.mkv"
    abc       := "abc" ; string
    abc       := a + b
    ;@AHK++AlignAssignmentOff
    ```
