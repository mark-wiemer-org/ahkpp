# AutoHotkey v1 Formatter

A very simple extension to format AHK v1 scripts. This is the same formatter that powers [AutoHotkey Plus Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mark-wiemer.vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus) (AHK++). It's been re-released as a standalone extension to resolve an issue with VS Code not finding the formatter for a user ([AHK++ issue #385](https://github.com/mark-wiemer-org/ahkpp/issues/385)).

This extension will be updated to match the AHK v1 formatter for AHK++ ðŸ˜€

This extension does not use Semantic Versioning. Instead, its version will match the earliest AHK++ version that uses it. The earliest version of this standalone extension is 4.1.0.

## AutoHotkey Plus Plus

[AutoHotkey Plus Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mark-wiemer.vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus) is the main extension, as it provides language support for both AHK v1 and v2: debugging, syntax highlighting, quick help, and more. New features and bugfixes are added frequently.
